DESCRIPTION:

Starting with Apple's SimpleDrillDown sample, we're building an iPhone app to connect to a web service running on Google App Engine.  The iPhone app provides a client interface to see which fruits and vegetables are in season near you, give some information about them and let you give some information back to the system.
