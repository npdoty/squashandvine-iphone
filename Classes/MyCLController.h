// This is for the location stuff, this class:
// (1) labels our class as adhering to CLLocationManagerDelegate protocol, which enables it to receive location event call backs; 
// (2) contains an instance of the CLLocationManager class â€” this will be used to register itself as a delegate for events and 
// to activate location updates.

#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>

// This protocol is used to send the text for location updates back to another view controller
